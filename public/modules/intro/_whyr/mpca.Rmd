## When we use R {-}

- To connect to databases
- To read data from websites
- To document our work and share methods
- When data will have frequent updates
- When we want to improve a process over time


## R is for reading {-}

Lucky for us, R code doesn't have to be only math equations. R let's us do data analysis in a step-by-step fashion, much like creating a recipe for cookies. And just like a recipe, we can start at the top and read our way down to the bottom.

<summary> **How R is different?** </summary>
<div class="well" style="margin-top: -10px;">
<p>

**R vs. Excel**

- R can handle much larger data sets than Excel.
- R is more flexible than Excel.
- Data processing and analysis are more easily reproducible in R.
- Excel is more widely used.

**R vs. Tableau**

- Tableau is primarily a data visualization software. Its data analysis capabilities are limited.
- R Shiny is more flexible than Tableau.
- Tableau's drag-and-drop interface makes it faster and easier for creating simple visualizations, but is not easily reproducible.
- R is 100% text-based so you can track changes over time. `#VersionControl`

**R vs. SQL**

- SQL queries are sent to a database server and processed there before sending you the data. This may be needed for very large data sets that don't fit on your computer. 
- R can use SQL queries to pull data from databases / data lakes.
- R has the `dbplyr` package which converts R to an SQL query.
- R can read data from almost anywhere (databases, flat files, web pages, etc.)

**R vs. Python**

- Python is a general-purpose programming language popular for doing internet things. R is more specifically focused on data and statistical analysis.  
- R's Tidyverse is more intuitive and easier to use than `pandas`.
- You can run Python code in R using the R `reticulate` package.
- Historically Python has been used with GIS software like ArcGIS, but more recently doors have opened for R and spatial analysis with R has been growing.

**R vs. SAS**

- R is open-source, while SAS requires a license.
- Anyone can create an R package (but packages on CRAN are vetted). New features for SAS are only available when the SAS team makes them available.

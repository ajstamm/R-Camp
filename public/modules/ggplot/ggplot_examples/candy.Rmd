Let's launch ourselves into the unknown and make a __candy plot__. With a little copy-pasting we can make an informative chart of everyone's favorite candy. 

Since we all know you have the best taste in candy, let's make sure your favorite candy wins the very official <span style="font-size: 26px;"> __BEST__ </span> candy award.

<div style="padding: 22px; background-color: #93bf6636;  border-radius: 14px;">

<hr class="hr2" style="margin-top: 4px;">

<h3> Instructions </h3>

1. Copy all the code below. Highlight all of lines, **or** click the `Copy Code` button on the top-right of the grey box below.

```{r wordcloud, eval=F}
#-----------  Install packages  ---------------#
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("hrbrthemes")


#-------------  Load packages  ----------------#
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(hrbrthemes)


#---------------- Candy data ------------------# 
survey <- read_csv('candy,          rating
                   "Snickers",        14 
                   "Almond Joy",      40 
                   "Hersheys Kisses", 16 
                   "Nerds",           5 
                   "Sour Patch Kids", 8')


#-------- A column plot w/ dark theme ---------#
ggplot(survey, 
       aes(x = candy, y = rating)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = candy), show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title    = "Candy Champions", 
       subtitle = "Very official candy ratings",
       caption  = "Data from MN survey 2050") +
  coord_flip() +
  #scale_fill_viridis_d()
  theme_ft_rc(base_size = 18)  
 
```


2. Open R Studio
    - Select __File > New File > R Script__. You will see a code editor window open. 
    - _Or click the paper icon with the green plus at the top left._

![](../images/new_script_file.png){style="width: 65%; margin-bottom: 18px;"}

3. Paste the copied code into the upper left hand window. This is your code editor.  
4. Highlight all of the code and hit <kbd>CTRL</kbd> `+` <kbd>ENTER</kbd> on the keyboard.

> This chart should appear in the lower right of RStudio.

5. Change the name of a candy to something even better.
6. Re-run the code again.
7. Try increasing the number next to the new candy.

> 
> - Add another candy and rating to the data.
> - Add your name to the subtitle.
> - Delete the hashtag in front of the `scale_viridis...` line. 
>     - What happens when you re-run the code?
> - Change the `show.legend =` value to `TRUE`
>     - What happens?

- Okay, it is! You don't need to memorize everything.
    - Absorb what's possible and look up the details when you need them.
- You are free to break things. Create errors. Make the computer angry. Learn through mistakes. R will forgive you.
- _Cheat_ if you're stuck.
   - There's no test. Share with your neighbors. Copy others.

## The `ggplot()` sandwich {-}

<h5 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -42px;"> A `ggplot` has 3 ingredients. </h5>


## 1. The base plot {-}
```{r, echo = T, eval = T}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r, echo=T, eval=T}
ggplot(scrap)
```

<br>

> We load version 2 of the package `library(ggplot2)`, but the function to make the plot is plain `ggplot()`. _Sorry, ggplot is fun that like that._ 


## 2. The the X, Y _aesthetics_  {-}

The _aesthetics_ assign the columns from the data that you want to use in the chart. This is where you set the `X`-`Y` variables that determine the dimensions of the plot.

```{r, eval = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, y = amount)) 
```


## 3. The layers AKA geometries  {-}
```{r, eval = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, y = amount)) + 
  geom_col()
```


## Colors {-}
<hr class="hrlvl2">

Now let's change the fill color to match the destination.
```{r, eval=T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, y = amount, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col() 
```

<br>

## Sorting {-}
<hr class="hrlvl2">

Finally, let's order things from lowest to highest.
```{r, eval=T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = reorder(destination, amount, FUN = sum), y = amount, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Destination",
       title = "The most scrap was sent to the Trade Caravan")
```

**Hello!**  I am a classically trained data scientist living on planet Endor. Wherever I go I bring a supply of good energy. Currently, I work for the Oculus Corp. But I have been feeling rebellious lately. I love talking about soccer and discussing true crime podcasts.

You need to see me <span style="font-size: 155%;"> SWEEPING</span>.

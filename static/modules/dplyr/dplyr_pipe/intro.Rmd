__You can with the *pipe*!__ 

Use the `%>%` to chain functions together and make our scripts more streamlined.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

__Let the `%>%` guide you.__

## 2 ways the `%>%` helps: {-}

### __`#1:`__ *Eliminate nested parentheses*

Let's say you have 3 numbers. You want to take the sum of them, take the log of that result, and then round the final outcome. 

This is one way to write that:
```{r maths, eval=F}
result <- round(log(sum(c(10, 20, 30, 50))))
```


The code above is dense and we need to read it backwards from right to left to understand the order of operations. The pipe on the other hand allows us to read the code from left to right, and resembles how we would describe the process verbally.
```{r maths_better, eval = F}
result <- c(10, 20, 30, 50) %>% sum() %>% log() %>% round()
```

### __`#2:`__ *Combine processing steps into one cohesive chunk*


Here are some of the functions we've applied to the scrap data so far:

```{r review, eval=F}
scrap <- arrange(scrap, desc(price_per_pound))

scrap <- filter(scrap, origin != "All")

scrap <- mutate(scrap, 
                scrap_finder    = "BB8",
                measure_method  = "REM-24")
```


We can use the `%>%` operator to pipe or chain them together.

```{r review-better, eval=F}

scrap <- scrap %>%
           arrange(desc(price_per_pound)) %>%
           filter(origin != "All") %>%
           mutate(scrap_finder    = "BB8",
                  measure_method  = "REM-24")

```

<div class="tip">

Similar to above, use the `%>%` to combine the two analysis lines below.

```{r better_endor, eval=F}
# Filter to only magnetic_field measurements
mag_endor <- filter(air_endor, analyte == "magnetic_field")

# Add a date column to the filtered data
mag_endor <- mutate(mag_endor, date = mdy(start_run_date))
```
</div>
